**Abstract:**

Grant free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-
NOMA) is a promising access method for massive machine type
communication (mMTC), which has several advantages when
compared to the conventional grant based access method, such
as, reduced latency, smaller scheduling and signalling overheads,
and improved energy efficiency. Since there is no explicit grant
given to each user in GF-NOMA, detecting all the active users
present, i.e., active user detection (AUD) at the base station (BS)
becomes crucial. Typically, AUD is performed using correlation
with all possible preamble sequences transmitted by the GF-
NOMA users. Recently, deep learning (DL) based models have
emerged as a viable alternatives for AUD. However most of these
works assume perfect timing and frequency synchronization of
users, which hardly occurs in practice. In this work, a GF-
NOMA scheme and a deep neural network (DNN) model for
AUD are proposed. The proposed scheme is compatible with
the narrowband Internet of things (NB-IoT) and the proposed
DNN-based AUD mechanism accounts for the impact of timing
and frequency offsets. It is demonstrated that the performance
of proposed DNN based AUD scheme is comparable (or slightly
better) than the conventional method while providing a significant
reduction in the computational complexity.
